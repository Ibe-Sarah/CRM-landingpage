            The following are some reasons why client management is crucial in a CRM:<br>
           <br> 1. Customer retention: Clients management helps in building long-term relationships with customers, which leads to higher customer retention rates.

            <br> 2.Communication: CRM projects involve multiple stakeholders, including users, management, IT staff, and vendors. Project management helps to ensure that everyone is on the same page, understands their roles and responsibilities, and can communicate effectively.
            <br>3.Coordination: A CRM project involves many different activities, such as data migration, system configuration, user training, and testing. Project management helps to coordinate these activities and ensure that they are completed in the right order and on schedule.
            <br> 4.Budget and resource management: A CRM project can be costly and requires the allocation of resources, such as staff time and IT infrastructure. Project management helps to ensure that the project stays within budget and that resources are used efficiently.
            <br>5.Quality control: A CRM system is only as good as the data that is entered into it and the processes that are used to manage that data. Project management helps to ensure that data quality is maintained and that the system is being used effectively
